# Optimization and Parallelization with MPI, OpenMP and OpenACC

This repository includes three projects focused on the parallelization of computationally intensive problems using MPI, OpenMP, and OpenACC. Each project tackles performance improvement for a classic computational science problem:

**1. Laplace Equation Parallelization with MPI:** Implementation that distributes computations across multiple processes to enhance efficiency via inter-node communication.

**2. K-means Algorithm with OpenMP:** Optimization of pixel-to-cluster assignments using multithreading, maximizing CPU resource utilization.

**3. K-means Algorithm with OpenACC:** Acceleration of centroid computation by leveraging GPU capabilities for massive parallelization.
